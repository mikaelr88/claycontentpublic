<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></p>

All data is stored locally on your device. If you have iCloud enabled, Apple may sync your data between devices.
</p>

<p><strong>Do you collect any personal data?</strong></p>
<p>
No. The app does not collect personal information, analytics, or tracking data.
</p>

<p><strong>How do I back up my work?</strong></p>
<p>
We recommend enabling iCloud backups on your device or exporting your data regularly if that feature is available.
