<h1>About This App</h1>

<p>
This app was created to help ceramic artists document their work over time — from early stages to finished pieces.
</p>

<p>
It is intentionally simple, offline-first, and focused on preserving your creative process.
</p>

<p>
An optional in-app purchase is available to support continued development.
