<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>
This app is designed to help ceramic artists document and share their work.
Your privacy is important, and the app is built to collect as little data as possible.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
The app does not collect personal information, create user accounts, or track users.
</p>

<p>
All ceramic pieces, photos, notes, and metadata you create are stored locally on your device.
If you enable iCloud through your device settings, Apple may sync this data across your devices.
</p>

<h2>Photos and Camera Access</h2>

<p>
The app requests access to your camera and photo library only so you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photograph ceramic pieces</li>
  <li>Add existing photos to your collection</li>
</ul>

<p>
Photos are not uploaded to any external servers by the app.
</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>
The app may offer an optional in-app purchase to support development.
Payments are processed entirely by Apple.
The app does not receive or store your payment information.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
Your data is not shared with third parties.
Content is only shared when you explicitly choose to share it using system share features.
</p>

<h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>

<p>
The app does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking technologies.
</p>

<h2>Your Control</h2>

<p>
You control your data. You may delete content at any time by removing it from the app or deleting the app entirely.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>
If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the app developer through the App Store listing.
